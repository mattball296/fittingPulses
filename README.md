# fittingPulses

Copy of a Python exercise from Uni involving creating noisy data representing a SiPM pulse then fitting to a gaussian model. Pulses with low amplitude are discarded due to high variance in fitted parameters, then the amplitude of remaining pulses is plotted as a histogram, before the histogram is fitted to the sum of gaussian curves.
